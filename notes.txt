Intro...

Lesson 10
Docker options for Windows

Lesson 11
Docker Windows setup

Lesson 12
Docker Windows 7,8, 10 Home setup

Lesson 13
Docker Mac
Don't use homebrew to install docker 
Checkout terminal completion for docker.

Lesson 14
Docker Linux
Better to install by following instructions from docker website.
Don't use pre-install setups (install docker manually)
Don't use 'apt' to install docker, it might be too old version
`get.docker.com` - script to install docker
adding yourself to a docker group (remove sudo for every command) can be potential security issue.
docker-machine - needs to be installed manually
docker-compose - need to be installed manually

Lesson 18
`docker version` - Display info about client and server versions (check client/server status)
`docker info` - Display system-wide information

Lesson 19
Image - binaries and libs and source code that makes up an application
Container - running instance of am image
Registry is like github for docker
`docker container run --publish` `-p` - set port
`docker container run --detach` `-d` - run in a background
`docker ls` - see list of containers
`docker ls -a` - see list of containers including stopped
`docker stop` - stop a container by id
Container name must be unique
`docker container run --name` - give container a name
`docker logs` - see logs of a container
`docker logs -f` - tail logs
`docker container top` - list of processes in the container
`docker stats` - Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
`docker container rm` - removes a container
`docker container rm -f` - remove container even if it is running (stops it first)

Lesson 20
When running `docker container run`:
1. Looks in local cache for an image
2. Looks in remove repository (defaults to docker hub)
3. Downloads an image in found and stores it in local cache
4. Creates a new container of that image (starts a new layer of changes on top)
5. Give a virtual IP on private network in docker
6. Opens a port if specified
7. Start using a command specified (like entrypoint?)

Lesson 21
Containers are not mini virtual machines. They are restricted processes.
* They are processes
* Limited to what resources they can access
* Exit when process stops

Lesson 23
Assignment - Running basic containers
--env -e - environment variables

Lesson 24
Assignment - Running basic containers

Lesson 25
docker container top - process list in one container
docker container inspect - details of one container config
docker container stats - performance stats for all containers

Lesson 26
docker container run -it - start a new container interactively
docker container exec -it - run addition command in existing container
docker container -ai - similar at '-it' but for start command
-i, --interactive          Keep STDIN open even if not attached (allows connection running)
-t, --tty                  Allocate a pseudo-TTY ("fake" terminal)
